# The TigerGraph Team

<font size=5> **Welcome! Are you a high school student interested in programming or entrepreneurship? If so, this is the perfect place for you!** </font>

Ahh, let's take a step back. First, some introductions ðŸ˜„.

We're TigerGraph, a Graph Database startup based in Redwood City, CA.

## **Introducing TigerGraph**

TigerGraph is a **native parallel graph database** that can load and analyze large
amounts of data in real-time. In comparison to traditional relational databases,
TigerGraph's architecture and accompanying graph query language (GSQL) allow
for <font color='#DD6EOF'> **quick, efficient, and powerful analytics** </font>.

### **Goin' Graphs**

The following blog post summarizes the importance of Graph Databses.

As summarized neatly by Oracle,

    <font size=4> Graph technologies have become a **groundbreaking way** for organizations </font>
    <font size=4> everywhere to address uses that other methods simply canâ€™t address in an </font>
    <font size=4> **efficient manner**. </font>

Now that we've established the power of Graphs, one looming question remains:

Now, how do we go about creating our own?

### The Cloud Portal

TigerGraph graciously provides a free-tier cloud portal open to all. Creating an
account is as simple as navigating to its [website](https://tgcloud.io/) and clicking
on the orange **Login/Register** button. We'll cover setting up one's first solution
in the ensuing *"Dashboarding 101"* section.
