# Community Projects

Want to upload your own projects? As the club year progresses, we'll add resources
for how to format and submit your amazing works! Make sure to stay tuned 😁

As a reminder, your submissions may be featured on TigerGraph's very own...

Here, you'll have the opportunity to present your projects to a panel of industry
experts, researchers, VCs, and more! This event will take place sometime in the
Spring 🥳.
