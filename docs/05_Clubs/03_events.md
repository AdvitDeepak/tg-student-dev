# Exciting Events

TigerGraph will host events exclusively for clubs to participate in, including:

* TigerGraph Clap Wars
* TigerGraph Student Conference (a "Shark Tank" or "Tiger Tank" type of competition)

If you or your club wants to host a local conference, message us here so we can help promote it!

## **Upcoming Events**

???+ note "Clap Wars"

    To accompany all of your projects, write a blog, record a video, or more! As soon as you do, we'll help promote it.

    You'll then have the rest of the quarter to promote your blog as much as you can. Be sure to give everyone in the competition 50 claps on Medium! At the end of the quarter, the blog with the most claps wins! We'll also have "Stars Wars" and "Like Wars" for GitHub repositories and YouTube videos!

???+ tip "Tiger Tank"

    At the end of the year, compete in a "Shark Tank" style competition, pitching your awesome TigerGraph projects to real companies!
