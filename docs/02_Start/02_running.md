# Running a Club 101

## **Step 1 - The Prerequisites**

There are a few things that need to be decided upon, including:

* Club Members - Should aim to have at least ten students!
* Club Advisor - Preferably a CS or STEM teacher/mentor
* Date/Time - Deciding on a location as well as schedule

On the last note, clubs are expected to meet at least twice a month (biweekly). More
specifics of club prerequisites will be discussed during your Virtual Chat with a
TigerGraph representative!



## **Step 2 - Before Meeting 0**

Next up, some advertising!

We'll provide you with flyers, resources, and more to help you get started. Additionally,
we'll promote your club chapter on our TigerGraph Instagram, Discord, and Twitter.

> TODO: Insert hyperlinks for each of those three accounts!

### **Welcome Box**

Prior to your first meeting, you'll be receiving a welcome box.

Here's a little sneak peek ðŸ˜„.

Inside, you'll find:

* <>
* <>
* <>

Pretty exciting to kickoff your first club meeting!

### **Club Charter**

Another important item you'll be receiving is the Club Charter. This document outlines
the general club procedures in terms of rules, structures, requirements, and more.

This document is quite important to review as a club!

We'll be requiring a signature and acknowledgement submission after this first meeting.

Let's segue into that!

## **Step 3 - During Meetings**

Meetings will be largely up to the club ambassador's discretion!

In general, most club meetings will be comprised of the following activities:

* <>
* <>
* <>
* <>

Here's a sample timeline for how the school-year might be broken down:

## **Step 4 - After Meetings**

After meetings, club members may be given some optional take-home material, including:

* <>
* <>
* <>

However, all of this is completely optional!  

## **Step 5 - The Long Run**

Our goal is to create self-sustaining clubs that can teach new students how to learn, create, and share
new, innovate creations with the developer community.

Our long-run goal is that you and your club will
be independent, able to organize events, network with other
chapters, and engineer your future without any required support.
