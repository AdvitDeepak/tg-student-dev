# Running a Club 101

## **Step 1 - The Prerequisites**

There are a few things that need to be decided upon, including:

* <font color='#DD6EOF'>**Club Members**</font> - Should aim to have at least ten students!
* <font color='#DD6EOF'>**Club Advisor**</font> - Preferably a CS or STEM teacher/mentor
* <font color='#DD6EOF'>**Date/Time**</font> - Deciding on a location as well as schedule

On the last note, clubs are expected to meet at least <font color='#DD6EOF'>twice a month (biweekly)</font>. More
specifics of club prerequisites will be discussed during your Virtual Chat with a
TigerGraph representative!



## **Step 2 - Before Meeting 0**

Next up, some advertising!

We'll provide you with flyers, resources, and more to help you get started. Additionally,
we'll promote your club chapter on our TigerGraph Instagram, Discord, and Twitter.

&nbsp; &nbsp;

### **Welcome Box**

Prior to your first meeting, you'll be receiving a welcome box.

Inside, you may find:

* Tons of <font color='#DD6EOF'>TigerGraph</font> Merch ü§©
* Personal Mascot <font color='#DD6EOF'>Plushie</font> ü•∞
* Additional Info Flyers üòç
* Pamphlets, Posters üòé
* Food (ex. <font color='#DD6EOF'>Pizza!</font>) ü•≥

Pretty exciting to kickoff your first club meeting!

### **Club Charter**

Another important item you'll be receiving is the <font color='#DD6EOF'>Club Charter</font>. This document outlines
the general club procedures in terms of rules, structures, requirements, and more.

This document is quite **important to review** as a club!

We'll be requiring a signature and acknowledgement submission after this first meeting.

Let's segue into that!

## **Step 3 - During Meetings**

Meetings will be largely up to the club ambassador's discretion!

In general, most club meetings will be comprised of the following activities:

* *Introduction, Recap, and General Updates*
* *Learning Content <font color='#DD6EOF'>(interspersed w/ hands-on projects)</font>*
* *Review Activity or Game*
* *Project Time and Closing*

Here's a sample timeline for how the school-year might be broken down:

## **Step 4 - After Meetings**

After meetings, club members may be given some optional take-home material, including:

* *Reviewing certain <font color='#DD6EOF'>education modules</font>*
* *Learning and <font color='#DD6EOF'>researching</font> new technologies*
* *<font color='#DD6EOF'>Continuing the projects</font> they started in class*

However, all of this is completely optional!  

## **Step 5 - The Long Run**

Our goal is to create self-sustaining clubs that can teach new students how to ***learn, create, and share***
***new innovations*** with the developer community.

Our long-run goal is that you and your club will
be <font color='#DD6EOF'>independent, able to organize events, network with other</font>
<font color='#DD6EOF'>chapters, and engineer your future</font> without any required support.

You've got this! We believe in you üòÅü•≥
