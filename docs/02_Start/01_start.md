# How to Start a Club   

Interested in creating a club? Well, it's quite simple!

It's as simple as it sounds, fill out the interest form!

Some information to have handy before filling this out:

## **Step 2 - Virtual Chat**

Next, a TigerGraph representative will reach out to you within a week to schedule a call. This
quick chat will go over logistical information, including club structure, support,
and funding. Here's a breakdown:

After this, you'll be asked to fill a supplemental form. Although this form can be found below,
you may not have receive access until TigerGraph shares it directly with you.

This form will contain additional information including:
