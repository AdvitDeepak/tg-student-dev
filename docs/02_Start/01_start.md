# How to Start a Club   

Interested in creating a club? Well, it's quite simple!

## **Step 1 - Interest Form**

It's as simple as it sounds, fill out the <font color='#DD6EOF'>interest form!</font>

Some information to have handy before filling this out:

* School <font color='#DD6EOF'>Name</font>
* School <font color='#DD6EOF'>Address</font>

&nbsp; &nbsp;

[Fill out Interest Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDmFba1iYK3Q6zJ7dRtWxkIsO5ggI9LsLz7Gl39t7lqJF-HA/viewform?usp=sf_link){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

&nbsp; &nbsp;

## **Step 2 - Virtual Chat**

Next, a TigerGraph representative will reach out to you within a week to <font color='#DD6EOF'>schedule a call</font>. This
quick chat will go over <font color='#DD6EOF'>**logistical information**</font>, including club structure, support,
and funding.

Here's a breakdown:

* Discuss TigerGraph and the Student Developer Program <font color='#DD6EOF'>overview</font>
* Discuss club <font color='#DD6EOF'>logistics</font> (timeline, advisors, schedule)
* Discuss <font color='#DD6EOF'>day-to-day</font> procedures (TigerGraph support)
* Discuss overarching goals and <font color='#DD6EOF'>vision</font>
* Discuss <font color='#DD6EOF'>next steps</font> to get started

&nbsp; &nbsp;

## **Step 3 - Supplemental Form**

After this, you'll be asked to fill a <font color='#DD6EOF'>**supplemental form**</font>. Although this form can be found below,
you may not have receive access until TigerGraph shares it directly with you.

This form will contain additional information including:

* Providing the names/information of your <font color='#DD6EOF'>ambassador team</font>
* Providing the <font color='#DD6EOF'>contact info</font> for your school and advisor
* Coming up with a club <font color='#DD6EOF'>mascot, profile, and bio</font>
* Sending in team <font color='#DD6EOF'>pictures</font> (w/ media release)

&nbsp; &nbsp;

&nbsp; &nbsp;

And voila, after this, your club is ready to go! From this point on, your club
will be assigned a <font color='#DD6EOF'>**TigerGraph representative**</font> who will be your primary point of
contact.

Next up, recruiting members and running your club!
