# Plotly & Dash

Plotly is an *interactive graphing library* used to visualize data.

It is quite powerful in terms of its features and is rather easy to learn and begin working with. Two Plotly modules we'll be using in
our dashboard can be summarized below:

* Plotly Express: <font color='#DD6EOF'>**a high-level wrapper for creating visualizations**</font>
* Plotly Dash: <font color='#DD6EOF'>**a Python framework for easily building applications**</font>
